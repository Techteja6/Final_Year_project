# Final_Year_project
# Smart Home Automation System with Speech Recognition and Power Measurement

## Short Description
IoT-based smart home automation system using Raspberry Pi 4, Python, and sensors (ACS712 & ZMPT101B) for **voice-controlled appliance operation**, **real-time power monitoring**, and **automatic overload protection**. Data is visualized on the **ThingSpeak dashboard**.

---

## Project Overview
This project implements a **secure and intelligent home automation system** that allows users to:

- Control home appliances via **voice commands**  
- Monitor **real-time voltage, current, and power usage**  
- Automatically **disconnect appliances** in case of overload  
- Visualize data remotely on **ThingSpeak IoT dashboard**  

Unlike other implementations that require custom smart sockets, this project integrates all functionalities **at the program level**, making it cost-effective and easy to deploy.
